# 💓 Stress Level Prediction App

<div align="center">


**A modern, AI-powered web application that predicts stress levels using heart rate variability analysis**

</div>

---

### Problem
Stress is a growing health concern that can negatively impact mental and physical well-being. Measuring stress accurately often requires complex tools or professional assistance, which may not be accessible to everyone.

### Solution
This app provides an easy-to-use, AI-driven tool to predict stress levels using heart rate variability (HRV) data, offering personalized insights and recommendations for stress management.

### Idea
Leverage machine learning to analyze heart rate metrics and deliver real-time stress predictions through a user-friendly web interface, empowering users to monitor and manage stress effectively.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the **Stress Level Prediction App** on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

---

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.8 or above)
- pip (Python package manager)

Python libraries used:

- `streamlit`
- `seaborn`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`

> 📌 You can also install them via `requirements.txt` (see below).

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Basmala-ElKady/stress-level-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
    cd stress-level-prediction
    ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    # Create virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
   
    # Activate it:
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
      
    # On Linux/Mac
    source venv/bin/activate

    ```

4. **Install project dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   This will install all required packages for the app to run.



### Usage

**Run the Streamlit app with:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app/app.py 
    ```

**Then open your browser and go to:**
   `http://localhost:8501`
